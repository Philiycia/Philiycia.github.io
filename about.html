            <h2>What Are Freshwater Fish?</h2>
            <img src="images/freshwater-habitat.jpg" alt="Natural freshwater stream habitat with various fish species and aquatic plants" class="section-image">
            <p>Freshwater fish are aquatic animals that live in water with low salt content, typically found in rivers, lakes, streams, and ponds. These fish have adapted to thrive in environments where the water salinity is less than 0.5 parts per thousand, making them distinct from their saltwater counterparts.</p>
            <p>Malaysia's tropical freshwater systems are home to numerous indigenous fish species. These habitats provide ideal conditions for many popular aquarium fish species, which naturally originate from tropical regions similar to Malaysia's climate.</p>

            <img src="images/fish-comparison.jpg" alt="Side-by-side comparison of freshwater and saltwater fish species in their respective habitats" class="section-image">
            
            <h3>Key Differences</h3>
            <article class="comparison-card">
                <h4>Water Salinity</h4>
                <p><strong>Freshwater:</strong> Less than 0.5 ppt (parts per thousand)</p>
                <p><strong>Saltwater:</strong> 30-40 ppt with dissolved salts and minerals</p>
            </article>

            <article class="comparison-card">
                <h4>Fish Osmoregulation</h4>
                <p><strong>Freshwater Fish:</strong> Their bodies are more concentrated than surrounding water, so they absorb water passively and must actively excrete excess water through dilute urine.</p>
                <p><strong>Saltwater Fish:</strong> Their bodies are less concentrated than surrounding water, so they lose water passively and must drink seawater to compensate, excreting excess salt through gills.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="comparison-card">
                <h4>Tank Maintenance</h4>
                <p><strong>Freshwater:</strong> Generally easier to maintain, more forgiving water conditions, suitable for beginners</p>
                <p><strong>Saltwater:</strong> More complex chemistry, requires precise salinity levels, requires more advanced aquarium knowledge</p>
            </article>

            <article class="comparison-card">
                <h4>Cost Considerations</h4>
                <p><strong>Freshwater:</strong> Lower equipment and fish costs, less maintenance equipment needed</p>
                <p><strong>Saltwater:</strong> Higher initial investment, specialized equipment, more expensive livestock</p>

            <h2>The Importance of Proper Aquarium Care</h2>
            <img src="images/aquarium-setup.jpg" alt="Well-maintained freshwater aquarium with plants, rocks, and healthy fish swimming" class="section-image">
            
            <h3>Why Proper Care Matters</h3>
            <p>Maintaining proper aquarium conditions is essential for the health and longevity of your fish. Poor water conditions can lead to stress, disease, and premature death of aquatic life.</p>

            <h3>Essential Care Elements</h3>
            <article class="care-element">
                <h4>🌡️ Temperature Control</h4>
                <p>Most tropical freshwater fish require temperatures between 24-28°C. Consistent temperature is crucial for fish metabolism and behavior. Sudden fluctuations can cause stress and illness.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="care-element">
                <h4>💨 Filtration and Aeration</h4>
                <p>A proper filtration system removes waste products and maintains oxygen levels. Mechanical, biological, and chemical filtration work together to keep water clean and safe for fish.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="care-element">
                <h4>🧪 Water Quality Monitoring</h4>
                <p>Regular testing of pH, ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels is essential. Most freshwater fish prefer a pH between 6.5-7.5, with zero ammonia and nitrite levels.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="care-element">
                <h4>🌱 Tank Decorations and Plants</h4>
                <p>Live plants provide oxygen, absorb excess nutrients, and create natural hiding spaces that reduce stress. Decorations provide enrichment and territory for fish behavior.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="care-element">
                <h4>🍖 Proper Nutrition</h4>
                <p>Different fish species require different diets. Quality commercial fish food, supplemented with varied nutrition, ensures proper growth and coloration.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="care-element">
                <h4>🔄 Regular Maintenance</h4>
                <p>Weekly water changes (20-30%), filter cleaning, and tank cleaning prevent the buildup of harmful substances and maintain optimal living conditions.</p>
