                <p>Clownfish are omnivorous and will eat a variety of foods including high-quality marine pellets, frozen mysis shrimp, and brine shrimp. Feed twice daily with small portions. They will also nibble algae and zooplankton in the tank. Ensure diet includes both meaty foods and vegetable matter for balanced nutrition.</p>

                <h3>Symbiotic Relationship with Anemones</h3>
                <p>In the wild, clownfish have a famous symbiotic relationship with sea anemones. The fish are immune to the anemone's sting and receive protection, while the clownfish help feed the anemone. In captivity, they don't require anemones to survive, but appreciate them. Ensure any anemone is properly acclimated and fed.</p>

                <h3>Three Fascinating Facts About Clownfish</h3>
                <ol class="facts-list">
                    <li><strong>Sex Change Ability:</strong> All clownfish are born male. In a group, the largest and most dominant fish becomes female. If the female dies, the dominant male undergoes a sex change to become female, with the next male in hierarchy becoming the breeding male.</li>
                    <li><strong>Famous from Finding Nemo:</strong> Clownfish gained worldwide popularity after the 2003 movie "Finding Nemo." Unfortunately, this led to massive overharvesting from wild reefs. Most aquarium clownfish are now captive-bred to protect wild populations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Immunity to Stings:</strong> Clownfish have a special mucus coating that protects them from anemone tentacles. Scientists believe this is created through a gradual acclimation process where the fish slowly familiarizes itself with the anemone's sting.</li>

                <h3>Diet and Feeding</h3>
                <p>Firefish are carnivorous and prefer small meaty foods. Feed high-quality frozen or live mysis shrimp, copepods, and brine shrimp 2-3 times daily. They may accept high-quality marine pellets but prefer live or frozen food. In well-established tanks with natural food, they can supplement by hunting small organisms in the sand and rock.</p>

                <h3>Behavior and Tank Requirements</h3>
                <p>Firefish are famous for their rapid darting movements and tendency to hide in burrows. Provide sandy substrate where they can dig and create shelter. They're extremely fast swimmers and may injure themselves against glass, so the tank should have plenty of hiding spots and open swimming areas. They're generally peaceful but aggressive toward other firefish.</p>

                <ol class="facts-list">
                    <li><strong>Rapid Movement:</strong> Firefish can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in fractions of a second, making them some of the fastest fish in the ocean relative to their body size. This explosive speed helps them escape predators in their natural sandy habitat.</li>
                    <li><strong>Symbiotic Burrow Sharing:</strong> In the wild, firefish often share burrows with pistol shrimp in a mutually beneficial relationship. The shrimp digs and maintains the burrow while the firefish watches for predators, alerting the shrimp with tail signals.</li>
                    <li><strong>Goby-Like Behavior:</strong> Despite being classified differently, firefish exhibit behaviors similar to gobies, including their burrow-dwelling tendencies. They're one of the few fish that will readily accept captive-bred surroundings and create territory in a tank.</li>

                <h3>Diet and Feeding</h3>
                <p>Blue Tangs are primarily herbivorous and require plenty of algae and vegetable matter. Feed dried seaweed, algae pellets, and spirulina supplemented with small meaty foods. They grazer throughout the day in nature, so frequent small feedings work better than one large feeding. A well-established tank with natural algae growth helps maintain their health.</p>

                    <li><strong>Toxic Defense Mechanism:</strong> Blue Tangs have venomous spines near their tail that they use as a defense mechanism when threatened. These spines can cause painful injuries to predators and even humans, so handle with extreme care during tank maintenance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Movie Fame:</strong> The character Dory from the movies "Finding Nemo" and "Finding Dory" is a Blue Tang. This led to massive increases in demand for captive-bred Blue Tangs, making them one of the most popular saltwater aquarium fish despite their challenging care requirements.</li>
                    <li><strong>Algae Grazer Specialist:</strong> In the wild, Blue Tangs spend most of their day grazing on algae and small organisms on reef surfaces. A single Blue Tang can consume over 3 pounds of algae per year, making them important for reef ecosystem health.</li>

                <p>Lionfish are strictly carnivorous predators that require live or recently frozen fish. Feed feeder fish, silversides, or other appropriate-sized fish 2-3 times weekly. Do not overfeed as they can become obese. Some specimens may accept prepared foods over time, but live food is preferred. They're ambush predators that hunt actively in the evening.</p>

                <h3>Venomous Spines and Safety</h3>
                <p>Lionfish have highly venomous spines that can cause severe pain and swelling in humans. Handle with extreme care during tank maintenance using thick gloves and nets. The venom is a defense mechanism and not used for hunting. Never stick hands directly into the tank. In case of sting, seek immediate medical attention. Despite the danger, they're generally docile in captivity.</p>

                <ol class="facts-list">
                    <li><strong>Venomous Predator:</strong> Lionfish are one of the few venomous fish in the ocean. They use their venom-tipped spines purely as a defense mechanism, not for hunting. Some species can produce enough venom to kill a human, making them one of the most dangerous reef fish.</li>
                    <li><strong>Invasive Species Problem:</strong> Lionfish are native to Indo-Pacific waters but have become an invasive species in the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean. They have no natural predators and eat enormous quantities of native fish, causing significant ecological damage to invaded reef systems.</li>
                    <li><strong>Elegant Hunting Style:</strong> Lionfish are ambush predators that use their elaborate fins to herd and trap prey fish into corners. Once prey is cornered, they quickly open their large mouths and create suction to swallow the fish whole in a fraction of a second.</li>

They will not typically accept prepared foods. A well-established tank with abundant natural zooplankton is essential. Many beginners fail to keep these fish because they starve in clean aquariums without sufficient live food populations.</p>

                <h3>Specialized Tank Requirements</h3>
                <p>Mandarin fish require mature tanks (at least 6+ months old) with abundant live food. They're bottom-dwellers that spend most of their day picking through sand and rocks searching for tiny organisms. The tank should be well-established with a healthy population of copepods and amphipods. Frequent water changes that disrupt the zooplankton population can be detrimental to their survival.</p>

                    <li><strong>Synchronized Mating Dance:</strong> In the wild, mandarin fish perform an elaborate mating dance at dusk. A pair will synchronize their movements and rise together into the water column to spawn, creating a beautiful underwater ballet. This behavior is rarely observed in captivity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Challenge for Aquarists:</strong> Mandarin fish have a reputation for being the hardest fish to keep alive in captivity.

                <h3>Diet and Feeding</h3>
                <p>Seahorses are extremely slow feeders that require live food. They primarily eat tiny copepods and live mysis shrimp. They must be hand-fed or have abundant populations of live zooplankton. Feed 2-3 times daily in small amounts. They cannot compete with aggressive fish for food and will starve if placed in tanks with faster-feeding fish species.</p>

                <h3>Tank Environment and Behavior</h3>
                <p>Seahorses require calm, low-flow tanks with plenty of seagrass, gorgonians, or other holdfast plants. They use their prehensile tail to anchor themselves and move very slowly through the water. The tank should have minimal current to prevent exhaustion. They prefer to stay in one area, making them poor swimmers that need protected habitats. Seahorses mate for life and often stay together.</p>

                <h3>Three Fascinating Facts About Seahorse</h3>
                <ol class="facts-list">
                    <li><strong>Male Pregnancy:</strong> Seahorses are the only fish species where the male becomes pregnant. The female deposits her eggs into the male's pouch where he fertilizes and incubates them until they're fully developed, then releases hundreds of tiny, independent seahorse fry.</li>
                    <li><strong>Monogamous Partners:</strong> Seahorses are highly unusual in the animal kingdom for being monogamous. Mated pairs stay together for extended periods and can recognize each other individually. They often perform synchronized swimming movements as a bonding ritual.</li>
                    <li><strong>Conservation Concern:</strong> Seahorse populations worldwide are threatened by habitat loss, coastal development, and illegal collection for traditional medicine. Many governments now protect seahorse species, and most aquarium specimens are now farmed sustainably to protect wild populations.</li>
