                <h3>Diet and Feeding</h3>
                <p>Bettas are carnivorous and require high-protein foods. Feed premium betta pellets once or twice daily. Supplement with live foods like bloodworms and brine shrimp 2-3 times weekly for optimal color and health. Avoid overfeeding, as bettas are prone to constipation.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="fish-details">
                <h3>Tank Setup Requirements</h3>
                <p>While bettas can survive in small containers, they thrive in larger tanks with proper filtration. Include plants (live or silk) for resting spots and territory. Males are territorial and should never be kept with other males. The tank should have gentle water flow as bettas prefer calm waters.</p>

                <ol class="facts-list">
                    <li><strong>Labyrinth Organ:</strong> Bettas possess a unique organ called the labyrinth, allowing them to breathe air directly from the surface. This enables survival in low-oxygen environments, though proper aeration is still recommended.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fighting Fish Heritage:</strong> "Betta" comes from "Bettah," an ancient Siamese word meaning "warrior." Bettas were historically bred for fighting in Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Malaysia.</li>
                    <li><strong>Color Changing Ability:</strong> Male bettas can change color based on mood, age, and diet. Stressed bettas appear pale, while healthy bettas display vibrant, saturated colors. Premium foods can enhance natural coloration.</li>

                <h3>Diet and Feeding</h3>
                <p>Guppies are omnivorous and thrive on quality flake food supplemented with small live foods like mosquito larvae and daphnia. Feed small portions twice daily. They will also nibble algae and plant matter. Variety in diet promotes vibrant coloration and overall health.</p>

            <section class="fish-details">
                <h3>Breeding Characteristics</h3>
                <p>Guppies are prolific breeders and are livebearers, meaning they give birth to fully-formed fry. If you want to control populations, separate males and females or provide dense plants where fry can hide and develop. One female can produce 20-30 fry every 30 days.</p>

                    <li><strong>Rainbow Variations:</strong> Male guppies display incredible color variety including red, blue, green, yellow, and black patterns. No two males are exactly alike, making each guppy unique. Females are generally drab gray for camouflage while pregnant.</li>
                    <li><strong>Live Bearers:</strong> Unlike most fish that lay eggs, guppies are livebearers. Females can store sperm and produce multiple batches of fry without additional male contact, allowing rapid population growth in favorable conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Adaptability:</strong> Guppies are extremely adaptable and can survive in various water conditions. They've been introduced worldwide for mosquito control in areas where malaria-carrying mosquitoes breed, making them important for public health efforts.</li>

                <h3>Diet and Feeding</h3>
                <p>Goldfish are omnivorous and require a balanced diet of high-quality pellets supplemented with vegetables like blanched peas and zucchini. Feed twice daily, only what they can consume in 5 minutes. Goldfish are prone to overfeeding and constipation, so moderation is essential. Include plants in the diet as they naturally graze on vegetation.</p>

                <h3>Space and Filtration Requirements</h3>
                <p>Goldfish produce significant amounts of waste and require robust filtration. They prefer cooler water than tropical fish and should not be kept with tropical species. A planted tank reduces waste buildup. Goldfish are bottom feeders and enjoy digging through substrate, so large gravel or sand works well.</p>

                <h3>Three Fascinating Facts About Goldfish</h3>
                <ol class="facts-list">
                    <li><strong>Long Memory:</strong> Contrary to popular myth, goldfish have excellent memory and can live for decades. They can recognize their owner, learn tricks, and remember training for years. Some goldfish have been documented living over 40 years.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ancient Heritage:</strong> Goldfish were selectively bred in China over 1,500 years ago from wild carp. They spread to Japan where selective breeding created fancy varieties with unique body shapes, fin types, and eye positions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Waste Producers:</strong> Goldfish produce roughly 2.5 times more waste than tropical fish of similar size due to their metabolism. This makes them "pigs of the fish world," requiring excellent filtration and frequent tank maintenance to prevent ammonia buildup.</li>

                <h3>Three Fascinating Facts About Angelfish</h3>
                <ol class="facts-list">
                    <li><strong>Breeding Devotion:</strong> Angelfish are one of the most devoted fish parents. Mated pairs will guard eggs and fry fiercely against all tank inhabitants. Both parents participate in caring for and protecting young, a behavior relatively uncommon among aquarium fish.</li>
                    <li><strong>Color Morphs:</strong> Through selective breeding, angelfish have been developed into numerous color patterns including marble, koi, gold, platinum, and striped varieties. Breeders continue to develop new patterns, making them favorites in the aquarium hobby.</li>
                    <li><strong>Body Shape Evolution:</strong> The distinctive triangular body shape of angelfish provides incredible maneuverability in their native South American river habitat with dense vegetation. Their vertical body orientation allows them to slip between aquatic plants with minimal resistance.</li>

                <ol class="facts-list">
                    <li><strong>Bioluminescent Colors:</strong> Neon Tetras possess chromatophores (pigment-containing cells) that create their famous electric blue stripe and red belly. The iridescent neon stripe is created by light refraction, not actual light production, making them appear to glow under certain lighting.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sleep Behavior:</strong> Unlike many fish that sleep with eyes open, Neon Tetras actually change color and lose their vibrant stripe at night, appearing almost invisible. This camouflage behavior protects them from predators during vulnerable sleeping periods.</li>
                    <li><strong>Migration in Nature:</strong> In their native South American rivers, Neon Tetras form massive schools numbering thousands of individuals. These schools migrate seasonally following water level changes and food availability, traveling kilometers through river systems.</li>

                <p>Discus fish are considered the "kings of aquarium fish" and require advanced husbandry. They are sensitive to water conditions and require pristine water quality with frequent water changes (25% twice weekly minimum). They prefer tall tanks with warm, soft, acidic water.

                <h3>Three Fascinating Facts About Discus Fish</h3>
                <ol class="facts-list">
                    <li><strong>Parental Care Beyond Eggs:</strong> Discus fish exhibit remarkable parental behavior unique among aquarium fish. After fry hatch, both parents produce a nutritious mucus coating on their skin that fry eat by nibbling their parents' bodies. This parental feeding continues for several weeks, ensuring fry survival.</li>
                    <li><strong>Selective Breeding Varieties:</strong> Through intensive selective breeding, discus fish now come in numerous varieties including red, blue, yellow, turquoise, and solid color patterns. Premium color morphs can cost hundreds of dollars per fish, making them highly sought by collectors and enthusiasts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sensitive to Sound:</strong> Discus fish are extremely sensitive to vibrations and loud noises. Sudden disturbances can cause permanent damage to their nervous systems, making them more prone to disease and behavioral problems. Placing tanks away from televisions and sound systems is critical for their wellbeing.</li>
